# Java-Maze
Random Maze Generator In JAVA

Working on a graphically pleasing MazeSolver. 
Run the .jar file to see the maze run.
You can slow down the speed of the maze by increasing the miliseconds in MazeBoard.

UPDATE 8/13/2019:
Finished the Maze Solver with Circles to demosntrate the pathing of the solution.
I would like to make a line step-by-step solution in MazeSolver.java
